I have added the following:
** Create Create a new level (a third level) and link the unused door in "aSharpPlace" to exit into the new room. (functionality not maintained after trying to link doors to previous rooms. Was working when the doors only went one way)
** In "aSharpPlace," implement teleport functionality for the "♨︎" symbols. Entering one should move the player to the other. (Currently the code is bugged where you can't move between rooms, but the teleporter works as it should. I had issues where the teleporter would vanish after taking it, which I solved by having the player land one step to the right of it)
** Make the X NPC characters perform a simple patrol (+/-2 from their starting locations). (Added enemies that patrol, but the code does not fully work, unsure how to solve)
** Create an animated splash screen (this was a group assignment from a previous week) using `splashScreen.mjs`.
